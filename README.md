# Dicee - Finished Project

---



This is the finished project from section 7 of the [Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/dicee-flutter) course on [AppBrewery]([https://www.appbrewery.co).



## Function

The user presses on either die and the screen will ‘roll’ them both.



## My Additions

1. Changed color
2. Added a text box that displays the sum of the two die.
